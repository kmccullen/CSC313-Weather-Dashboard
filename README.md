# CSC313-Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard Assignment

Your assignment is to create a weather forecast dashboard.

Data is available using a free API (Application Program Interface) on the web at https://open-meteo.com/

Your website should do the following:
- Allow the user to enter a latitude and longitude (FYI: Plattsburgh is 44.6995 N, 73.4529 W).
- Allow the user to select a forecast or historical data
- For the forecast, select a number of days and display the high and low temperature, and an image that represents the expected weather.
- For the historical data, select a number of parameters (such as dates, temperatures, dewpoint, etc), and plot the data.
- Allow the user to select Centigrade or Farenheit for temperatures.

You will probably want to use D3 to do the actual plotting of the data.

The website will respond to a REST API call with JSON.

Take note of the time assigned to data. By default, the timestamps will be in Zulu (Greenwich Mean Time).

The "Weather Code" indicates the type of weather expected. You'll need images or icons that correspond to those weather codes.

Be creative.
